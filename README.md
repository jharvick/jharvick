# Hey there, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

## Bio
I am an aspiring Software Engineer looking to make a career change that I am passionate about. I wanted to create this page to keep myself and whoever stops by aprised of my goals and what I'm currently working on to keep myself and my skills sharp. So I appreciate you stopping by and welcome any and all advice as I make the leap in to this exciting new stage of my career.

## Actualize Coding Bootcamp
I am currently enrolled in Actualize Coding Bootcamp and am loving every minute of it. Not only am I loving the course but every day I get more excited to be able to fully immerse myself in a career in tech. Learning these new skills has given me so much energy and passion that I am excited to bring in to my job search and eventual new career.

### Here is a rundown of what the class is focusing on:
#### Languages: Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL
#### Frameworks: Ruby on Rails, React.js, Bootstrap 
#### Databases/Libraries/Tools: Postgres, APIs, Node/npm, Git, GitHub

### Class Project:
The other big protion of the class is to complete a call project. I have done quite a bit of digging and have landed on a project focused on hacking. My long term goal is to go in to a carreer in cybersecurity and figured no better time to start learning than now. 

For my project I will be diving in to Linux! My goal is to write a bash script that will be able to check for sudo permissions that I can abuse within Linux. If anyone reading this has any advice for me as I begin to learn I would love to hear from you!
